### Project Description
SkillBoss is an AI-powered career architect that maps professional skills to ideal job roles through interactive discovery. It features a advanced, timed AI interviewer that evaluates candidate readiness, delivering a comprehensive performance audit of pros, cons, and targeted improvement areas to ensure  mastery of the skill or job.

### The Problem statement
Job seekers often face a "readiness gap" where they either struggle to map their existing skills to the right roles or fail to understand what skill their desired carrier has and enter interviews unprepared for high-pressure technical scrutiny. Existing platforms offer static job listings but fail to provide real-time, rigorous validation of a candidate's actual depth of knowledge.

### The Solution
SkillBoss bridges this gap by offering a dual-path career architect. Whether starting from a dream job or a specific skill set, users are asked to attend   a timed AI-simulated interview that goes beyond surface-level questions. The system delivers a comprehensive performance audit—highlighting pros, cons, and precise improvement areas—ensuring candidates are truly market-ready before they ever hit apply for a job.

 Core ComponentsFrontend (React/Next.js): Manages the dual-path entry (Known Job vs. Career Discovery) and the interactive interview UI.Backend API (Node.js/Python): The "Brain" in your VS Code terminal that routes data between the UI, Database, and AI.AI Engine (Gemini/GPT): Generates "CEO Level" questions and provides real-time analytical feedback.Database (PostgreSQL/Supabase): Stores the job-skill mapping, user profiles, and interview transcripts.Data FlowInput: User selects a path  System fetches Required Skills or Career Matches from the DB.Interview Loop: Frontend sends job context to AI AI generates strategic questions User submits answers for scoring.Output: System aggregates scores  Displays Evaluation & Skills to Improve Offers Retry or Resource links. Tech Stack InteractionVS Code Workspace: Houses the /frontend (UI), /backend (Logic), and .env (API Keys).REST Integration: The Frontend calls Backend endpoints (e.g., /start-interview) to trigger AI prompts.State Management: React handles the "Step-by-Step" flow from Start to End/Home.
